    <h1>The World of Ebensong</h1>
<section id="Phunol">
    <h2><strong>Phunol</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Phunol is a world quite literally smashed together,
        Three major powers rule the three vastly different territories,
        <strong>Altos</strong> a mountainous river lands, <strong>Kha’li</strong> a vast unforgiving desert, 
        and <strong>Miloren</strong> an enchanted forest of Redwoods. 
        Three different ecologies seemingly from different worlds entirely;
         yes some truly bizarre and potent magic holds the continent of 
         Phunol together but in return curses the land entirely. 
         Monster roamed free and uninhibited on Phunol and for many years the small pockets 
        for life that sprouted up were uprooted and scattered across the plane. 
        For civilization to thrive these groups banded together to defend their homes, 
        and when homes grew into cities these groups became guilds and defenses became hunts.
         And when that wasn’t enough these groups banded together and created the now 
         Legendary Guild known as the <strong>Association of Associated Monster Hunters.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Now many hundreds of years have passed and more guilds have come along, 
        guilds have even become strong enough to act as their own neutral world 
        power creating <strong>the Principalities of Guilds</strong> and all throughout those years the 
        AAMH has remained a reliable asset to the people of Phunol. 
        Though these days they have declined in notoriety and public perception,
         as you can imagine hunting monsters is a dangerous profession and the 
         AAMH likes to keep their numbers low, as players you have been specially 
         selected to join the ranks of the <strong>Association of Associated Monster Hunters.</strong>

    <h3>Miloren</h3>
    <p>
        Miloren <em>(my.loe.rin) </em> is the country directly to the north of the of both <strong>Kha’li</strong>
         and <strong>Altos</strong> and is known for its massive forest that stretches end to end of the 
         Continent of Phunol. Miloren is the headquarters of many guilds but the most 
         notably of them is the <strong> Association of Associated Monster Hunters </strong>, 
         one of the first guilds to ever establish itself, it was the establishment of
          guilds like this that helped turn Miloren and the other countries into the 
          civilization that they are today.
     </p>

     <p>
        There are three major cities in Miloren; Treklude, 
        the capital and located on the West side of the country, 
        Breakpoint, the border city to the Far North, and New Lobec City,
         the Easternmost city the borders then Blighted lands.
     </p>

     <p>
        Miloren’s Forest is filled to the brim with monsters of all types 
        from Beast that lurk in the forest or wander down from the frozen 
        tundra of the Far North to the undead horrors that seem to spawn 
        from the Blighted Lands to the East.

        <h3>Kha'li</h3>
        <p>
            Kha’li <em>(cah.lee)</em> is the country located on the southwestern coast of the continent of Phunol,
             life on Kha’li is defended by perseverance for they live in the most inhospitable part of 
             the continent. It is this way because Kha’li is an enormous desert with very few pockets 
             of civilization on the edges of the country. It is because of this the government of Kha’li 
             operates more like a collection of city-states agreeing to work together under a single Grand Poobah.
        </p>

        <p>
            Though the desert is vast and oppressive, life in Kha'li is not without its riches.
             The cities of Sahee and C’himermond produce resources like Glint Stones and Myr Stones 
             which are desired all across Phunol. There are Ruins scattered throughout the desert 
             and with them a vast amount of Relics can be found. The capital, Prism, has endless 
             stretching tunnels that lead to different parts of Kha’li and sometimes serves as a 
             convenient way around for some of the rich and important. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Kha’li does however suffer from a strange weather condition called Snarls, 
            a magical storm that can appear anywhere in the country and take the form of 
            any type of storm from a lightning storm to a dust storm, getting sucked into 
            a Snarl may kill you but has a higher chance of stranding you on some other part 
            of Phunol or even being lost forever.

 <section id="Altos">
    <article>
        <h3>Altos</h3>
        <p>
            Altos <em>(al.toes)</em> is the country located on the east side of the continent and borders the other two,
             Altos is very inspired by the Greek and Mediterranean areas. It is known for its many mountain ranges,
            swooping valleys, and multiple riverlands and Deltas. Altos is also the name of the capital city of Altos.
            They were once known for their populations of Dragons but since most dragons are extinct most that
            remain are long distant descendants with little relation to their ancestors such as Kobolds, Drakes,
             and Dreks the intelligent Dragon humanoid race on the continent.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most people that live in Altos either live on the water or in the many mountain ranges. 
            It is a mix of seafaring society and sherpas that help groups up the mountains. 
            Some cities like Spreet even have gondola systems to take them up to higher planes, 
            and cities like Menace and Splarta are full floating cities with canals and waterways. 
            Voltaria is one of the oldest territories in Phunol and holds knowledge from centuries 
            pass as well as the largest school for History and Magic called <strong>Zynthos’ College for Magical Knowledge.</strong> 
        </p>

        <p>
            The Country is governed by a council of elected individuals that reside in the capital city Altos,
            they typically have more of a vested interest with trade from the other countries especially Kha’li
            for their Voodootronics and Relics, while having a resentment of Miloren because they only border 
            they share with the country is covered by The Blighted Lands which bleeds over to Altos and becomes their problem.
